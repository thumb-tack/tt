= HOWTO OpenShift

This builds upon the link:../getting-started/[Getting Started] HOWTO.

== Download and start Minishift.

Minishift is the handy way to easily run OpenShift on your local machine.

----
minishift start --vm-driver virtualbox
----

== Configure your Environment

The following will make the `oc` command-line tool available on your path.
It will also cause your local Docker tooling to use the internal OpenShift Docker image repository.

----
eval $(minishift oc-env)
eval $(minishift docker-env)
----

== Do a build

The build uses the `fabric8-docker-plugin` to build and push an image to the internal OpenShift image repository.

The image is tagged `latest` and `1.0.0-SNAPSHOT`.

----
mvn install
----

== Deploy to OpenShift

Creat a new application using the image name and the `1.0.0-SNAPSHOT` tag.

----
oc new-app thorntail/myapp:1.0.0-SNAPSHOT
----

== Expose your application

Open port `8080` so you can access it.

----
oc expose svc/myapp
----

== Welcome to ThumbTack

Greetings and welcome to ThumbTack, the Java framework that combines the Eclipse Microprofile with your favorite Java libraries for a simple yet powerful development experience.
ThumbTack assumes one "application" per ThumbTack instance. There is a https://docs.thumbtack.af/1.0.0-SNAPSHOT/#flat-classpath[flat classpath], to add a Java library you just add it to your Maven pom.xml and you are good to go.

=== If you are coming from an Application Server background

Developing for ThumbTack will be different than you are used to, primarily, there is no "Application Server"
that you deploy your application to. When you write a ThumbTack application you need to add a _main method_
just like you used to do in your Java applications. On startup, ThumbTack will look for this _main method_ and
execute whatever is inside that method.

Because of the flat classpath there is no need to bundle your dependencies into a special directory of your
application or add them to a special directory in your application server. All you need to do to add a
jar from a library to your application is put it in your Maven pom.xml. This makes managing
your dependencies much easier.

=== On to our Hello World Application

Our "Hello World" application is going to use JAX-RS to serve up content at the base URL
of our application.

To get started we create a pom.xml which only really needs two elements beyond the
standard metadata.

* If we want code completion in our editor, the dependency on `thumbtack-jaxrs` artifact
